I'd like to announce the availability of a LaTeX2e sudoku
Package from CTAN.

INSTALLATION:
 - Run 'latex sudoku.ins' and copy the sudoku.sty file into
   a path searched by LaTeX.
 - Run 'latex sudoku.dtx' twice to obtain the documentation.

The sudoku package allows the user to typeset sudoku puzzles.

A sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid where some of the squares in the
grid contain numbers.  The rules are simple: every column can
only contain the digits 1 to 9, every row can only contain the
digits 1 to 9 and every 3x3 box can only contain the digits 1 to 9.

More information, including help and example puzzles, can be found
at www.sudoku.org.uk.  This site also has blank sudoku grids (or
worksheets), but you will not need to print them from there if you
have this package installed.
